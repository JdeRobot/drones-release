# drones

This repository contains all the code relevant to the drone exercises in the JdeRobot Robotics Academy.

## Usage

The packages provided here depend on the PX4 Firmware and SITL. We plan to provide this package as a deb file installable through `apt-get`, however, at the moment, the best method for the installation is to run the bash script to setup the dependancies and the catkin_ws and put the drone_wrapper package and rqt_follow_road package in the src.
